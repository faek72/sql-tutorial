2. Select **"New repository"**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `sql-tutorial` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: "Interactive HTML, CSS & SQL Tutorial"
   - Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - Check "Add a README file"
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 3: Upload Your Files

#### Option A: Upload via Web Interface (Easiest)

1. On your repository page, click **"Add file"** ‚Üí **"Upload files"**
2. Drag and drop these files:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `tutorial.js`
   - `README.md` (optional - there's already one)
3. Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**

#### Option B: Using Git (If you're familiar with it)

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sql-tutorial.git
cd sql-tutorial

# Copy the tutorial files into this directory
# (copy index.html, styles.css, tutorial.js here)

# Add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add SQL tutorial files"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. In your repository, click **"Settings"** (top right)
2. In the left sidebar, click **"Pages"**
3. Under **"Source"**, select:
   - Branch: **main** (or master)
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 5: Access Your Tutorial

## Important Notes for GitHub Pages

### File Names Matter!
- Keep the file named `index.html` (this is the default page GitHub Pages serves)
- All other files (`styles.css`, `tutorial.js`, `teacher.html`) must be in the same directory
- File names are case-sensitive!

### HTTPS is Automatic
- GitHub Pages serves everything over HTTPS automatically
- Students can safely access the tutorial from any device

### No Backend Required
- This tutorial runs entirely in the browser using SQL.js
- No database server needed
- SQL.js is loaded from a CDN (Content Delivery Network)

### Updates Are Easy
1. Edit your files locally
2. Upload them to GitHub (same process as Step 3)
3. Changes appear on your site within minutes

## For Teachers (Students, you are welcome to read further but it won't really apply to you!)

### What Students Will Learn

**HTML:**
- Document structure and basic tags
- Forms and input elements
- Semantic HTML

**CSS:**
- Selectors and properties
- Box model
- Basic styling and layout

**SQL:**
- SELECT queries with WHERE clauses
- ORDER BY sorting
- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, etc.)

### Teaching Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Have students run the example queries first
2. **Encourage Experimentation**: Breaking things is part of learning
3. **Use DevTools**: Teach students to press F12 to see the console
4. **Check Solutions**: All answers are in `teacher.html`
5. **Reset Database**: Students can reset to original data anytime

### Sample Database

The tutorial includes two tables:

**Students Table:**
- id, name, age, grade
- 8 sample students

**Courses Table:**
- id, name, instructor, credits
- 6 sample courses

## Customization

### Adding More Exercises

Edit `index.html` and add to the exercises section:

```html
<div class="exercise">
    <h4>Exercise X: Your Title</h4>
    <p>Your question here</p>
    <details>
        <summary>Show Hint</summary>
        <p>Your hint here</p>
    </details>
</div>
```

### Changing the Database

Edit `tutorial.js` - look for the `initializeDatabase()` function:

```javascript
// Add more sample data
db.run(`
    INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade) VALUES
        ('New Student', 20, 88.0);
`);

// Create new tables
db.run(`
    CREATE TABLE your_table (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        column1 TEXT
    );
`);
```

### Styling Changes

Edit `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, or layout.

## Troubleshooting

### "Database not loading"
- Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Check your internet connection (SQL.js loads from CDN)
- Try hard-refreshing the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### "Page not found on GitHub"
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
- Check that the repository is Public
- Verify the file is named `index.html` (case-sensitive!)

### "Styles not working"
- Make sure `styles.css` is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Check for typos in the file name
- Try clearing your browser cache

### "SQL queries not running"
- SQL.js requires an internet connection to load initially
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
